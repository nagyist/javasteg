Javasteg is built with Apache Ant.  Once ant is installed just go 
to the java steg directory and run the ant command:

    ant
        
Once the application is built you can run it with this command:

    java -jar dist/stegtest.jar lily.jpg
    
Pass in any other images you would like.  The program supports GIF,
JPG, and PNG.
