Building and Running javasteg
--------------------------------------

Javasteg is built with Apache Ant.  Once ant is installed just go 
to the java steg directory and run the ant command:

<pre><code>
    ant
</code></pre>
        
Once the application is built you can run it with this command:

<pre><code>
    java -jar dist/stegtest.jar lily.jpg
</code></pre>
    
Pass in any other images you would like.  The program supports GIF,
JPG, and PNG.
